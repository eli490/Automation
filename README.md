# **Learning Selenium Automation**

Welcome to my Learning Selenium Automation repository! This project is a personal journey into mastering Selenium for web automation. Here, I document my progress, experiments, and key learnings as I explore the power of Selenium.

## **Purpose**

This repository serves as my sandbox for experimenting with Selenium. It includes a variety of scripts and exercises that I’ve worked on to deepen my understanding of web automation, simulate user interactions, and automate web testing.

### **What’s Inside**

Beginner Scripts: Simple examples that helped me get started with basic Selenium concepts like element locators, interactions, and assertions.
